                I designed and iterated on the internal application for Walmart corporate office employees with two

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Human Resources (HR) tools and systems are scattered across external platforms, making it difficult
                  to access and complete tasks.
                </p>
                <h5>Problems</h5>
                <ul class="circle">
                  <li>Multiple tools and platforms</li>
                  <li>Manual process</li>
                  <li>Missing relevant learning paths</li>
                  <li>Time constraints</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Goal</h5>
                <!-- <p>Let users find and access the features they need when they need them. </p> -->
                <p>Make the convoluted HR processes simple</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>
                  All Walmart employees working in the corporate office, such as directors, managers, engineers, and
                  designers, are the target user, but <em>managers</em> were considered for creating initial persona and
                  thus recruited for user testings.
                </p>
                <h3>Full Scope</h3>
                <p>The HR activities are historically application- and product-centric. The fully integrated app will be
                  user-focused and action-based. It will provide the employees quick access to Me, Approvals Inbox,
                  Career, Learning, Money, Chat, Campus, and My Org.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <div class="portfolio-project design-process">
                  <h3>Product Requirement</h3>
                  <p>Product requirements were transmitted differently for each mini-app based on the complexity of the
                    requirements and the particular product managerâ€™s availability and preference.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="circle">
                    <li>For Me and Approvals, I had meetings with the product manager to get acquainted with the
                      project, where I took notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>For My Org, I received the product requirement document and user stories. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>UX Requirement</h3>
                  <p>The UX team delivered the design and UX requirements to the engineering team through presenting
                    demos in weekly meetings, uploading recorded videos of the prototype on the Confluence page, and
                    communicating in Microsoft Teams chat. At the beginning of each sprint, I presented the prototype,
                    and the engineers would ask questions about the particular screen or feature. Throughout the sprint,
                    they would reach out via Teams chat if there were additional questions or confusion. At the end of
                    the sprint, the engineering team gave a demo of the features they worked on, for which the UX team
                    reviewed and provided feedback had there been an inconsistency.
                  </p>
                  <h3>User Test</h3>
                  <p>I participated in conducting three usability testing in the form of 1:1 interviews with a live
                    Figma prototype using the System Usability Scale (SUS) score as the benchmark. The first one in
                    April tested Homepage, Profile, Chat, and Inbox mobile screens and desktop experience to see if
                    users can find the information they are looking for in the places they are looking at and whether
                    the process is intuitive and efficient. Based on the findings, I made design changes to Profile and
                    Inbox. The next one conducted in June was focused on My Org mobile flows and covered the Desktop
                    homepage, profile, and chat screens. The main tasks included searching for people, giving feedback
                    to a team member, transferring employees, and exiting an employee. Because My Org mini-app was
                    gaining a lot of attention from business partners, the most recent usability test was carried out to
                    understand the user experience with My Org and the intuitiveness of the information architecture for
                    the integrated application and determine what design changes to make. </p>

                  <p>Drop 0 Profile - Users want to have their job information readily available, instead of having to
                    go through another step. Also, they were not convinced that military status is more important than
                    other personal information such as disability or sexual orientation. Thus, the design changes were
                    made to reflect user needs. </p>

                  <img class="img-fluid wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s"

                  <p>Drop 0 Inbox - Users want to have the completed and pending tickets in separate inboxes.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Transfer Associates</h4>
                  <p>This has been the most challenging part of the project. First, I familiarized myself with the
                    existing transferring process. Then, based on user interviews, I identified the managerâ€™s problems
                    with the existing flows, such as having to go to different platforms for different steps and not
                    being able to transfer multiple team members at once. After studying the existing tool and hearing
                    these concerns, I have redesigned the Transfer Employees process. </p>

                  <p>Drop 1 My Team - Users want to be able to search people within their organization, see their team
                    metrics, and manage their requisition openings and new hires in one place. While the managers also
                    want to see their organization chart, including their supervisors and subordinates, the engineering
                    team pushed back and the business decided to consider it for the later drop given the time and
                    resource constraints. </p>

              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>Working alongside product manager and engineering team, I learned to leverage different stakeholders.
                As the user experience designer, I would go into meetings with business partners and engineering to
                advocate for the user experience. After getting the product requirements from product manager, I would
                design for the end users, but deliver the design to the engineering team, who is the immediate audience
                for the design. It was a great experience to work cross-functionally, adapted to agile team structure.
